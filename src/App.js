      A natural way to approach the problem is to introduce some sort of clock that is
coupled to the particle, and to define the tunneling time in terms of the change in the
clock variable from the time that the particle reaches the barrier to the time it emerges. It
is then possible to define the expectation time for the tunneling event in terms of the
expectation value of the clock variable, which is a quantum observable. Several
suggestions for quantum clocks have appeared in the literature [5]. In this paper I restrict
attention to an early proposal for a quantum clock by Salecker and Wigner [6], and later
elaborated by Peres [7]. This model deals not with moving wave packets or other timedependent states, but with stationary states for which the time enters as a changing phase:
e
iEt. The quantum clock essentially measures the change in phase, resulting in a duration
known as the phase time. Because one is dealing with stationary states, the clock
measures only time differences between two events, not the absolute time of either event.
